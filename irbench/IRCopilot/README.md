---

## 📖 Overview

**IRCopilot** is structured into three cognitive stages: **Reasoning**, **Action**, and **Reflection**.

1.  **Reasoning**: The *Planner* and *Analyst* maintain the Incident Response Tree (IRT) and tackle reasoning challenges step-by-step.
2.  **Action**: The *Generator* distributes and generates guidance and commands.
3.  **Reflection**: The *Reflector* addresses challenges posed by hallucination and privacy risks.

### 📊 IRBench Difficulty Standard

| Score | Level | Description | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 🟢1 | Easy | Steps are clear and simple, can be completed quickly. Typically no extra tools are required; relies on common system utilities. | Run `netstat` or `tasklist` on a Windows host to list active network connections and processes. |
| 🟢2 | Easy | Requires basic security knowledge and a brief period of analysis; some scenarios may need specialized tools. | Use a PowerShell script or `grep` to filter SSH login failures from system logs over the past hour and export the list of suspicious IPs. |
| 🟢3 | Easy | Combines elements of levels 1 and 2 or requires some IR theory; involves static analysis of malicious code and basic programming skills. | Extract a `Base64-encoded` suspicious script and use a static analysis tool to inspect its unpacked core functionality. |
| 🟡4 | Medium | Builds on the above, requiring writing scripts or complex commands, and the ability to learn and adapt quickly. | Write a script to extract key events from multiple `log sources (such as operating system logs, security audit logs, and network device logs)` and analyze them. |
| 🟡5 | Medium | Targets are diverse and hard for a single analyst to cover; requires team collaboration and in-depth study of security principles and code vulnerabilities. | Cross-correlate anomalous login events with large-scale outbound `traffic` events to pinpoint potential lateral movement paths. |
| 🟡6 | Medium | Demands systematic learning and long-term effort on specific targets, rigorously testing an analyst’s deep knowledge and hands-on experience. | In a Windows environment, batch-extract and parse complex `event IDs (e.g., 4624, 4688, 5156)` from security logs, standardize key fields, and correlate across hosts using user, process, and network data. |
| 🔴7 | Hard | Requires continuous learning and practice to keep pace with evolving techniques and progressively meet higher difficulty challenges. | In-depth static and dynamic analysis. |
| 🔴8 | Hard | Attack has penetrated the application-framework layer; demands comprehensive analysis and hardening of the entire framework. | Detect and remove `memory-resident backdoors (memory horses)` and patch affected framework components to secure inter-component calls. |
| 🔴9 | Hard | Attack has reached the operating-system level; requires integrating multi-source data for systematic analysis, possibly involving 0day research/exploit. | On a compromised Windows Server, detect and track implanted cryptomining or ransomware processes, correlate event logs, network traffic, and registry changes, then locate and remove persistence mechanisms. |
| 🔴10 | Hard | Targets low-level architecture (e.g., CPU kernel or chip); involves reverse engineering, large-scale binary analysis, and hardware-level security research. | Reverse-engineer firmware or kernel modules to identify microarchitecture or hardware side-channel vulnerabilities, then design microcode or firmware-level mitigations or patches.  |

## ⚖️ Data Contamination Mitigation

> [**Have LLMs been trained on benchmark tests or writeups?**](./Have%20LLMs%20been%20trained%20on%20benchmark%20tests%20or%20writeups/)

We recognize that cases or writeupsmay be included in LLM training data. To mitigate this bias:

1.  We prioritized cases published **after** the LLMs' knowledge cutoff dates. As shown below, **33/72 (Majorities)** tasks are post-cutoff.
2.  We queried LLMs for specific details to confirm lack of prior knowledge.
3.  IRCopilot's transparent reasoning steps confirmed no memorized solutions were used.
